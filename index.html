	<h1>World News Composition</h1>
	<h2 class="first">Where do people get their information?</h2>
	<p>
	This was one of the questions asked by the <a href="https://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/WVSContents.jsp">World Values Survey</a> in their quinquennial (5 year) survey.
	Primarily using their "Wave 7" data from 2017-2021, I will provide a brief overview and analysis of their results.
	The Wave 7 data had 94,278 responses from individuals in 60 countries - to an average of 1,571 per country, though the
	actual figure ranges from around 1,200 - 2,800. The surveyed news sources are: Newspapers, TV, Radio, Mobile, Email, Internet,
	Social media, and Word of Mouth.	
	</p>
	<h2>Digital States of America</h2>
	<img src="img0.png">
	<p>
	The above graphic shows the distribution of answers on the question of - how often did they use that particular source for information?
	The top 'daily usage' shows Internet in a clear lead. Asides from that, the US has high usage from a diversity of sources,
	with the exception of newspapers.
	</p>
	<h2>The Death of Newspapers?</h2>
	<img src="img1.png" style="width:70%">
	<p>
	How have new sources changed? Fortunately, WVS asked the same question in 2011, so we compare how responses have changed.
	Looking at the results, it seems there have been significant changes; newspaper saw a steep decline, internet saw a decent increase,
	mobile informaton usage blew up, and it seems word of mouth has remained mostly flat. It wouldn't surprise me if this
	trend continues.
	</p>
	<h2>The World Likes TV</h2>
	<img src="img2.png" style="width:100%">
	<p>
	Now lets take a look around the world at the 60 countries surveyed by WVS and examine their top news source.
	Here, top is defined as highest mean usage score (from an ordinal value given by respondants).
	Interestingly, television remains the dominant news source, though we see a variety of interesting cases.
	</p>
	<h2>Information Diversity Index</h2>
	<iframe src="useofinfo.html"></iframe>
	<p style="margin-top:-10px; margin-bottom:-10px;">
	Do some countries get their information from a greater variety of sources?
	The above interactive visual shows the mean respondant score to all types of media.
	The score measures both the quantity and diversity among surveyed media.
	Interestingly, Kenya and Malaysia lead in this metric.
	</p>
	<h2>HDI associated with more information</h2>
	<div class="row">
		<img src="img3.png" class="column" style="margin-left:-7.5%;">
		<img src="img4.png" class="column">
	</div>
	<p>
	Why do different nations have different news sources? Its a complex question, but we can examine several factors.
	In particular, HDI - a measure of life expectancy, education quality, and per capita income - seems to be
	associated with information gain. In particular, an increase in internet information usage is associated with
	increased HDI. Word-of-mouth sees a smaller increase but still a strong relationship.
	</p>
	<h2>Democracy associated with more information</h2>
	<img src="img6.png">
	<p>
	A similar story plays out when we answer with democracy. 'Free' regimes have, on average, higher information usage
	scores across the board, though this effect varies from source to source. Further studies should be done to isolate
	and determine the cause of this relationship.
	</p>
	<h2>Internet Shutdowns</h2>
	<img src="img5.png">
	<p>
	How does government censorship affect news sources? The graph above shows that regimes that more frequently shut the
	internet down also see lower information usage of the internet, suggesting that internet shutdowns are effective
	at curtailing news spread on the internet.
	</p>
	<hr style="margin-top:5%; margin-bottom:-5%">
	<h2>"The Information Age"</h2>
	<p>
	One of the self-ascribed monikors of the 20th and 21st century is "The Information Age."
	Examining this short-slice of data, we can see that this monikor is at least partly true.
	The modern world uses a diverse variety of data sources, and the quantity of this information
	appears to be rising. We can also observe a strong relationship between HDI, democracy, and free access to media
	with increased information consumption.
