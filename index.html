	<h1>World News Composition</h1>
	<h2 class="first">Where do people get their information?</h2>
	<p>
	This was one of the questions asked by the <a href="https://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/WVSContents.jsp">World Values Survey</a> in their quinquennial (5 year) survey.
	Primarily using their "Wave 7" data from 2017-2021, I will provide a brief overview and analysis of their results.
	The Wave 7 data had 94,278 responses from individuals in 60 countries - to an average of 1,571 per country, though the
	actual figure ranges from around 1,200 - 2,800. The surveyed news sources are newspapers, tv, radio, mobile, email, internet,
	social media, and word of mouth.
	
	Now let's first examine one particular country.
	</p>
	<h2>USA: Internet Nation</h2>
	<img src="img0.png">
	<p>
	The above graphic shows the distribution of answers on the question of - how often did they use that particular source for information?
	With the exception of low newspaper usage, the US has high usage of many different information categories, with 
	internet, mobile, and television standing out in particular.
	</p>
	<h2>The Death of Newspapers?</h2>
	<img src="img1.png" style="width:60%;">
	<p>
	How have new sources changed? Fortunately, WVS asked the same question in 2011, so we compare how responses have changed.
	Looking at the results, it seems there have been significant changes; newspaper saw a steep decline, internet saw a decent increase,
	mobile informaton usage spiked, and it seems low-tech word of mouth has remained mostly flat. It wouldn't surprise me if this
	trend continues.
	</p>
	<h2>The World Likes TV</h2>
	<img src="img2.png" style="width:100%">
	<p>
	Now lets take a look around the world at the 60 countries surveyed by WVS and examine their top news source.
	Here, top is defined as highest mean usage score (from an ordinal value given by respondants).
	Interestingly, television remains the dominant news source, though we see great variety.
	Some surveyed African nations and Venezuela rely on word of mouth. WeChat-centric China is the standout on phones.
	Some Anglo nations have adopted the internet with greater fervor.
	</p>
	<h2>Information Diversity Index</h2>
	<iframe src="useofinfo.html"></iframe>
	<p style="margin-top:-10px; margin-bottom:-10px;"> Do some countries get their news from a greater diversity of surveyed sources? The above interactive visual shows
		the mean score for a country of all responses to surveyed questions about media. The higher the score, the more
		that respondants of that country indicated that they consume more information and also from a greater diversity of sources.
		the respondents of a country consume more information and also from a greater variety of sources. Interestingly, Kenya
		and Malayasia lead in this metrix.
	</p>
	<h2>HDI associated with more information</h2>
	<div class="row">
		<img src="img3.png" class="column" style="margin-left:-7.5%;">
		<img src="img4.png" class="column">
	</div>
	<p>
	Why do different nations have different news sources? Its a complex question, but we can examine several factors.
	In particular, HDI - a measure of life expectancy, education quality, and per capita income - seems to be
	associated with information gain. In particular, an increase in internet information usage is associated with
	increased HDI. Word-of-mouth sees a smaller increase but still a strong relationship.
	</p>
	<h2>Democracy associated with more information</h2>
	<img src="img6.png">
	<p>
	A similar story plays out when we answer with democracy. 'Free' regimes have, on average, higher information usage
	scores across the board, though this effect varies from source to source. Further studies should be done to isolate
	and determine the cause of this relationship.
	</p>
	<h2>Shutting the Internet Down</h2>
	<img src="img5.png">
	<p>
	How does government censorship affect news sources? The graph above shows that regimes that more frequently shut the
	internet down also see lower information usage of the internet, suggesting that internet shutdowns are effective
	at curtailing news spread on the internet.
	</p>
	<hr style="margin-top:5%; margin-bottom:-5%">
	<h2>"The Information Age"</h2>
	<p>
	One of the self-ascribed monikors of the 20th and 21st century is "The Information Age."
	Examining this short-slice of data, we can see that this monikor is at least partly true.
	The modern world uses a diverse variety of different data sources and in greater numbers.
	As the world continues to develop, the data presented above suggests that information sources will diverse
	and consumption will increase. Yet we should also question how this greater flow of information
	affects us and the world around us.
